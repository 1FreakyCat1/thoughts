# thoughts/journal

This repository is for myself, it's a collection of my thoughts. I've received feedback that I'm aloof from people so this is a way for me to be more open about my feelings in hopes that I'll be able to convey them better to people in real life.

I debated making this private, however, I think it would serve me well to open this for people to give me feedback if they want.
