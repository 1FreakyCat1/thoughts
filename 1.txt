I've been depressed as of late. It feels as though I've been running away from all of my problems. I'm in New York as of writing this, far away from home, yet my issues still haunt me. I think that I lost myself in these past few months. ***** left me, I stopped making Youtube videos, I slacked on my marathon training and barely finished, I've been doing horribly at my internship, I lost my 630 day Anki streak, and the internet has forgotten about me. Pretty much everything I care about has left me. I can't see myself in a positive light. I'm only 1% of the person I was 6 months ago, what happened? For the first time in my life, I feel depressed. My "why" is wavering, do I still care about the things that gave me all that strength? All my momentum has vanished and every habit I've worked towards is gone. I miss ***** so much but she'll never come. back to me. I don't even know why she left me. I spent all my free time watching pointless Youtube videos. I thought that I broke that habit, but it's come back full swing. I've been breaking out and I can barely look at myself in the mirror. I'm terrified of taking my mask off in public because people might see me. They'll see my skin. If they know me from my channel, they know that I failed. I was unable to keep it up, but as the haters said, I couldn't take it anymore and gave out. I feel like nothing. For some reason, my goals are still here and they've become my enemy. I want so much. My life, though, has become so complicated. There is still something deep within me, a voice screaming at the top of its lungs, "WAKE UP!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IS THIS THE EXTENT OF YOUR RESOLVE??" I'm too scared to listen to this voice. I want to drown it out so I listen to Youtube videos and the same songs over and over. I'm weak and I'm scared. What if I fail again. I know that I have what it takes. I believe in myself yet I doubt everything I do. "I KNOW YOU'RE A WARRIOR. NO ONE BELIEVED IN YOU, YET LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID. YOU BELIEVED IN THE ME THAT BELIEVED IN YOU. YOU HELPED PEOPLE." Why do I have to make my life so dramatic. Can't things just stay how they were. I want everything that I lost back with interest. I know I always bounce back stronger, yet this time I can't seem to find the ignition button. Believe in yourself James.
